# Bolt Alerter
A configurable plugin for [Bolt Launcher](https://bolt.adamcake.com/) which can alert you when various things happen in-game.

This plugin is NOT:
- **an "AFK Warden"**. Its function is to send alerts to the user. AFK activity is the main thing it's useful for, but not the only thing.
- **a programming language**. I'm aware that people have used alt1's AfkWarden and its almost turing-complete nature to do crazy things like help with PvM encounters or crowdsource data, but this plugin is simpler and smaller in scope than that. If you want to do those things, make your own plugin.
- **a bot/macro/cheat/etc**. Bolt plugins have no ability to automate gameplay or interact with the game, as doing so would be against the terms of service. The only action this plugin will ever take is to notify the user based on the things it can see on the screen.
